I'm Øystein (Øsse), a programmer living in Oslo with my wife and my two-year
old daughter. I am currently employed at Infront as a backend developer. I have
previously worked in Ceragon Networks and Data Respons. My main language
professionaly is C++. [See my resume](cv).

I am addicted to Git and regular expressions.

I like to help/teach when I can. I have held presentations at work about Rust
and Git.

I have a race bike (my [carbon stallion](bike.jpg)) that I ride way too seldom,
and I like to play ping pong.


## Skills

### Programming/scripting languages

I have used C++ my whole career; at my current job we're not afraid of taking
advantage of whatever features our compiler has been able to implement, e.g.
`<format>` and `<ranges>`. Other stuff I know fairly well:

- C,
- Rust,
- Bash/Zsh,
- Powershell,
- Lua,

#### Other tools

- **CMake**: Used professionally in most projects,
- **MSBuild**: Improved the build system at my current job, although I'd prefer
  to replace it with the above...
- **Shell-related tools**: Fairly good knowledge of shell-related tools, e.g.
  `sed`, `awk` and others,
- **Protobuf**: Used Protobuf as a serialization format in several projects,
- **Wireshark**: Wrote a dissector for a custom proprietary protocol,
- **Asciidoc**,

## Open source stuff

I try to contribute to open source projects when I can (and what). I have
submitted a few patches to Git [that got
accepted](https://github.com/git/git/commits/master/?author=Osse).

I am currently working on porting Git's topolgical sorting to
[Gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) which I hope to use to
implement other tools for Git in Rust. I have a [collection of
scripts](https://github.com/Osse/git-scripts) that would be neat to have in a
compiled language, especially on Windows.

I wrote [Shotwin](https://github.com/Osse/Shotwin) to practice SQLite and QML.
It worked (works?) very well for what it is, but I haven't worked on it for
many years now; more and more Ubuntu became my main OS at home so the need for
Shotwin diminished.

I like to provide (and get) help, so I try to help out on IRC in topics I know.
I frequent IRC channels related to Vim, Git, shells, C++ and Rust.

## Trivia:
